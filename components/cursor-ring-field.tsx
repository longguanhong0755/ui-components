/**
 * CURSOR RING FIELD — a Poisson-scattered field of soft capsules that a pulsing
 * ring, dragged along under the pointer, lights up and shoves outward.
 *
 * A port of a shipped Three.js hero into this folder's raw-GL family. The
 * interaction, the motion and the framing are the source's, term for term. The
 * machinery underneath is not: no Three.js, no GSAP, no bundled Poisson library.
 *
 * WHY GPGPU AND NOT A PURE VERTEX-SHADER SCENE. Most scenes in 3d/ compute a
 * point's position from time and a seed alone, so nothing has to be remembered.
 * This one leaks: each frame a point keeps 80% of last frame's displacement,
 * its scale eases toward the ring band, and its "energy" is a decaying
 * accumulator of that scale. That history lives in a floating-point texture —
 * one texel per point, `xy` position, `z` scale, `w` energy — integrated by a
 * fragment shader into a second texture which is then swapped in. The CPU never
 * touches a particle.
 *
 * WHAT THE RING IS. Not geometry. It is three smoothsteps of the distance from
 * each point's HOME position to the ring centre: a wide band (`t`), a thin hot
 * band (`t2`), and the fill inside (`t3`). Those sum into the point's target
 * scale, and `t2` alone drives a radial shove away from the centre. Sampling
 * from HOME and not from the live position is what keeps the ring a ring — read
 * the live position and a shoved point carries its own halo with it, smearing
 * the band into a comet.
 *
 * THE INTERACTION IS THE SOURCE'S, AND ONLY THE SOURCE'S. The camera is fixed.
 * The pointer moves the RING, never the camera — there is no orbit, no drag, no
 * gesture state. A pointer over the component is ray-cast onto the field plane
 * and the ring eases toward that point on a 130ms time constant, with a small
 * noise jitter riding on top. With no pointer — which is every frame on the
 * Framer canvas — the ring wanders on two slow 1D value-noise walks at 0.01
 * instead, so the scene is never dead and the canvas and the preview agree. A
 * single eased `follow` scalar crosses between the two, target AND rate, so the
 * pointer arriving or leaving never steps the ring.
 *
 * The cursor reach is the source's 0.175 and not the exact plane mapping (which
 * would be 1/5). The ring therefore trails the pointer at 87.5% of its
 * displacement from centre, which is what keeps the band inside the frame at
 * the edges. It is deliberate, and the probe asserts the ratio rather than
 * asserting a round-trip that would fail by design.
 *
 * THE SIMULATION IS PER-FRAME, ON PURPOSE. Its decay constants are NOT
 * normalised to wall-clock time. The position line is a feedback loop, not a
 * relaxation, so its equilibrium depends on the decay — normalise it and every
 * late frame rescales the whole field about the origin, a ~20px correlated
 * radial pulse that reads as depth flicker. Full working in the comment above
 * SIM_FRAG. Only the ring's cursor follow is dt-corrected, and only because it
 * IS a relaxation: its equilibrium is the pointer either way, so varying the
 * rate cannot make it pulse.
 *
 * Rule 6 recipe: ONE GL context built in useEffect([]); every live input read
 * from a ref inside a raw rAF loop (raw rAF ticks on the Framer canvas, unlike
 * IntersectionObserver / framer-motion appear props). Never calls
 * loseContext() — getContext() hands back the SAME force-lost context on the
 * next StrictMode mount and renders black. Density rebuilds the buffers and the
 * textures, never the context.
 *
 * CONTEXT LADDER: WebGL2 + EXT_color_buffer_float (RGBA32F), else WebGL2
 * RGBA16F (colour-renderable in core, no extension), else WebGL1 +
 * OES_texture_float + WEBGL_color_buffer_float, else a STATIC fallback that
 * runs the same field maths inline in the render vertex shader with the memory
 * terms dropped. The fallback still breathes and still follows the ring; it
 * just has no lag. Shaders are GLSL ES 1.00 so one set compiles on both.
